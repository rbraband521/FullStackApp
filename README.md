# Course Directory 
## A Full Stack React App with REST API

This repo houses the front and back end code for my course-directory project. This project can be run locally. In order to deploy this project I had to create separate repos for the API and the React App. Here are the links to those repos if you'd like to look around those instead:

#### API deployed on Heroku
<https://github.com/rbraband521/course-directory-api-heroku>

#### React App deployed on Vercel
<https://github.com/rbraband521/course-directory-client>

#### Here is a link to the final project live website
<https://course-directory-full-stack-app.vercel.app/>
